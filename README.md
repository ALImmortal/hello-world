# Welcome to my profile!
Hi, my name is Anne and I am currently working on a Computer Science major at Hunter College. 
I have been studying a lot on Java and C++. I am also trying to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to expanding my coding knowledge.
The first project I have made is OCR Conversion, which is a website that allows users to get text from images files. This was done as a group project for my Capstone course at Hunter.
In addition, I have been working on a project for my Operating Systems course where I have been working on creating a mock version of a Operating System.
